## 👩‍💻 About Me  
🔬 Worked at [Genomize](https://genomize.com/) and [the Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry](https://www.ibch.ru/en/about) as a Bioinformatician.  
📝 1st author of an article: ["FCRL4 and exhausted B cell signature in tumor infiltrating B cells from lung cancer"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.29.626090v1).  
🎓 MSc in Applied Bioinformatics + BSc in Chemical Technology.  
📚 6 years of teaching experience.  

## 📗 Projects 
* [Pathogenicity Benchmark and Visualization](https://github.com/EugeneShchoka/Bechmarking): Tools for analyzing and visualizing pathogenicity predictions from variant classification platforms. It compares predictions from Genomize-Seq and Competitor tools against ClinGen's curated truthset using metrics like F1, precision, and recall. Key features include Sankey diagrams and radar charts for intuitive data representation.
* [Comparative transcriptome analysis of B lymphocyte populations infiltrating tumors and expressing IgA and IgG](https://github.com/EugeneShchoka/Transcriptomics-Tumor-infiltrating-MemoryBCells): The research explores the role of tumor-infiltrating FCRL4-expressing memory B cells with an exhausted phenotype in the progression of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC), identifying their potential as a prognostic factor in LUAD.

## 📕 Learning Projects
* [SNP-file-conversion](https://github.com/EugeneShchoka/SNP-file-conversion): This repository contains code to determine REF and ALT alleles.
* [VCF Metrics Calculator](https://github.com/EugeneShchoka/Vcf-metrics-calculator): This Python script processes a Variant Call Format (VCF) file to calculate metrics, update the VCF with additional information, and generate a JSON summary of the metrics.
* [Human T Cell Profile](https://github.com/EugeneShchoka/FlowCytometry-TCellProfile): The Human T Cell Profile project processes flow cytometry data to identify and classify human T cell populations using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and machine learning, with scripts and pipelines for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result generation.
* [Bio container](https://github.com/EugeneShchoka/Bio-container): This Docker container provides an environment for bioinformatics analysis, including tools like [samtools v1.21](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), [bcftools v1.21](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools) and [vcftools v0.1.16](https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools). It is designed to simplify genomic data processing tasks by pre-installing and configuring all necessary dependencies. The container is based on Ubuntu 22.04 for compatibility and ease of use.
